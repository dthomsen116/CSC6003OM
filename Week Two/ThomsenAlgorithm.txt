1: Define the board size and number of ships
2: Using the setupBoard() func, create a board that will be used for the current game
3: Show the user the board using the drawBoard() function
4: Ask the user for two guesses; a row value and a column value
5: Check the user input to see if a ship was hit using the checkBoard() function
6: Inform the user that they hit a ship or missed
7: Loop through steps 3-7 until there are no more ships to be hit
