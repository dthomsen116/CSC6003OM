1. Define an Account class to represent a customerâ€™s bank account. Each account stores:
   - A randomly generated 8-digit account number.
   - First and last name of the account owner.
   - 9-digit social security number(string).
   - A 4-digit randomly generated PIN.
   - A balance in cents.
   - Includes methods for:
     - Depositing and withdrawing funds.
     - Validating the entered PIN.
     - Printing account details with SSN masking and dollar formatting.

2. Define a Bank class to manage up to 100 accounts. It includes methods to:
   - Add a new account.
   - Remove an account by account number.
   - Find and return an account by account number.
   - Add monthly interest to all accounts based on an annual percentage.

3. Define a CoinCollector class to calculate the total value of coins from a string input.
   - Valid characters: P, N, D, Q, H, W.
   - Ignore invalid characters and show a warning.
   - Return the total coin value in cents.
 
4. Define a BankUtility class with helper methods:
   - Prompt the user for a string.
   - Prompt the user for a positive number (with re-prompting on invalid input).
   - Convert dollar amounts to cents.
   - Generate a random integer within a specified range.
   - Check if a string is numeric (used for PIN validation).

5. Implement a helper function called promptForAccountNumberAndPIN(bank) that:
   - Prompts the user to enter an account number.
   - Verifies the account exists in the bank.
   - Prompts the user for a PIN.
   - Validates the PIN against the account.
   - Returns the Account object or None if validation fails.

6. In the main() function:
   - Create a Bank object to manage all accounts.
   - Enter a loop to repeatedly display a menu with the following options:
     1. Open an account
     2. Get account information and balance
     3. Change PIN
     4. Deposit money in account
     5. Transfer money between accounts
     6. Withdraw money from account
     7. ATM withdrawal
     8. Deposit change
     9. Close an account
     10. Add monthly interest to all accounts
     11. End Program

7. For each menu option:
   - Option 1: Prompt for first name, last name, and SSN. Generate account number and PIN.
     Create an Account and add it to the Bank.
   - Option 2: Prompt for account number and PIN. If valid, display account info.
   - Option 3: Prompt for current PIN. Then prompt for a new PIN twice and validate before saving.
   - Option 4: Prompt for amount to deposit. Convert to cents and update the balance.
   - Option 5: Prompt for two accounts and PINs. Transfer the specified amount if funds are sufficient.
   - Option 6: Prompt for amount to withdraw. Withdraw if sufficient balance exists.
   - Option 7: Prompt for ATM withdrawal in multiples of $5. Show bill breakdown and update balance.
   - Option 8: Prompt for a coin string. Calculate total and deposit to account.
   - Option 9: Prompt for account number and PIN. Remove the account if valid.
   - Option 10: Prompt for an interest rate. Apply monthly interest to all accounts.
